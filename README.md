# My-Open-Source-Papers

I like to research stuff, so I created this repo of all the 'papers' I write about the stuff I am researching/making. Enjoy :D

## Why

Well, as I said, I like to research stuff and explain them to other people. If people can use any of the information given in any of these papers, I am happy! I just work on this in my free time or when I'm bored, so don't expect there to be a new paper every single day.

I'm trying to keep every paper somehow math, code and science related, so that it is easier to understand for developers of different kinds.

_BTW, I call them "papers", but they are just projects I have been working on._

## Current papers and progress

Finished | Title | Current progress | Word count | Character count

[ ] | Letting users make choices | 0% | 0 | 0

## Can I help

YES, ofcourse you can post a PR or submit issues as you please. You can edit existing _papers_, but you can also submit your own. I am trying to keep some kind of quality in these _papers_, but I won't try to push that too much. Keep in mind, if you are correcting something or adding something to another paper, please be kind. Being rude is NOT neccesary.

To create a paper, create a folder with the name of the paper, then create a `paper.md` file and all other recources will be put into that folder.

## Sources

If you are using any sources (Websites, papers, research, etc.) please list them at the end or under the _"Sources"_ header in the file.
